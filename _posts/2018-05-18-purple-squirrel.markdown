_Purple Squirrel_

### Meaning

Something you will eventually find if you look long and hard for it. A dimond in the rough. Like when a recuriter calls me looking for someone with two years experience that is an EXPERT in DB2, SQL Server, Mongo DB, Cassandra, database design, docker, can be a project manager and system admin of 30 servers at the same time. And he wants to pay you like an intern at 20 hours a week.

### Etymology

Wikipedia: While it is unclear when exactly the term was coined, it was in use by 2000, and in 2010 CBS published material using the term, writing that "businesses are looking to do more with fewer workers, so they want [purple squirrels] who are able to take on a wide range of duties."

### Example

_Good luck, sounds like someone looking for a purple squirrel._
