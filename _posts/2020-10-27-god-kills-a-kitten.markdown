_God kills a kitten_

### Meaning

Don't do that thing, experts don't do that.

### Etymology

Apparently this comes from a phrase originating from a Georgetown University satire publication, and made popular on Fark.com in 2002. That saying was "Every time you masturbate ... God kills a kitten". Really, I didn't need to know that. Why do I post to this site, anyway, and when I do, why do I do questionable google searches on a work computer?

### Example

_"Every time a command line DBA uses a GUI, God kills a kitten."_
