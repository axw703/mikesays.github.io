_Crotch Goblins_

### Meaning

Children. Generally other people's children, but can also refer to one's own spawn.

### Etymology

Oddly, the term seems to be used by a younger generation, and often by the childless. However, Mike is old and has THREE of his own. It seems that some younger breeders have picked up the term and used it proudly in things like bumper stickers that advocate "Vaccinate your Crotch Goblins" or "Crotch Goblin on Board". Mike claims to have seen an image on Reddit of one of these stickers.

### Example

_"Vaccinate your Crotch Goblins"_
